              of the player’s hand to replace. The application should then evaluate both hands and determine who
              wins. Now use this new application to play 20 games against the computer. Who wins more games,
              you or the computer? Have a friend play 20 games against the computer. Who wins more games?
              Based on the results of these games, refine your poker-playing application. (This, too, is a difficult
              problem.) Play 20 more games. Does your modified application play a better game?
              7.34 (Project: Card Shuffling and Dealing) Modify the application of Figs. 7.9–7.11 to use Face
              and Suit enum types to represent the faces and suits of the cards. Declare each of these enum types as
              a public type in its own source-code file. Each Card should have a Face and a Suit instance variable.
              These should be initialized by the Card constructor. In class DeckOfCards, create an array of Faces
              that’s initialized with the names of the constants in the Face enum type and an array of Suits that’s
              initialized with the names of the constants in the Suit enum type. [Note: When you output an enum
              constant as a String, the name of the constant is displayed.]
              7.35 (Fisher-Yates Shuffling Algorithm) Research the Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm online,
              then use it to reimplement the shuffle method in Fig. 7.10.
              Special Section: Building Your Own Computer
              In the next several problems, we take a temporary diversion from the world of high-level language
              programming to “peel open” a computer and look at its internal structure. We introduce machinelanguage
              programming and write several machine-language programs. To make this an especially
              valuable experience, we then build a computer (through the technique of software-based simulation)
              on which you can execute your machine-language programs.
